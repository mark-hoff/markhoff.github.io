    <h1>Research</h1>

<p>My work explores language variation at the intersection of morphosyntax and pragmatics, primarily in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian (and occasionally English and French). I adopt quantitative, usage-based approaches (including, increasingly, Construction Grammar) to uncover and make sense of the contextual conditioning behind speakers' choices of linguistic forms.</p>

<p>Lately, I have a particular interest in the qualitative description of previously unstudied pragmatic markers common among young(ish) Argentines. These forms provide valuable insights into areas of study such as negation, polyphony, common ground, etc. </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 1.5em; font-size: 0.95em; color: #444;">
      Abstract: Ah re (lit. ‘ah, very’) is a pragmatic marker characteristic of Argentine Spanish that has been frequent in Millennial and Gen Z discourse for over two decades. Despite extensive commentary about its associations with the Flogger online subculture of the early 2000s (Suero 2020) and its perceived overuse, the pragmatic functions of ah re have received little scholarly attention. Although Kornfeld and Kuguel (2013) and De Luca (2019, 2021) document the use of ah re and ah re que to humorously reject a preceding utterance as in (1) and (2) where ah re could perhaps be glossed as just kidding (see Haugh 2016), this does not account for the full range of ah re constructions or functions.
(1) No me interesa. Ah re. (adapted from De Luca 2021, dialogue 1)
‘I don’t care. Just kidding.’
(2) Odio a Javier. Ah re que es mi mejor amigo. (adapted from Kornfeld & Kuguel 2013, example 27a)
‘I hate Javier. Just kidding, he’s my best friend.’
I build upon this prior work to offer the first in-depth sociopragmatic analysis of ah re constructions. Using posts from Twitter and BlueSky, I show that ah re also frequently appears in an ah re + noun/adjective construction as in (3) and, as in (4) and (5), does not always straightforwardly negate a prior utterance but rather allows speakers to disalign in more nuanced ways. 
(3) hay gente que baila muy mal 🤣 Ah re forra... pero sí 🤷🏼‍♀️ (@lauoctober14)
‘Some people dance really bad. Lol I’m such an asshole… but it’s true’
(4) A: si fuera un superhéroe, ¿qué superpoder tendrías?
B: súper fuerza para romperle la cara a los que le coquetean a mi novio ah re tóxico igual sí (@serenitoxoxx)
‘A: If you were a superhero, what super power would you have?
B: Super strength to beat up anybody who flirts with my boyfriend, lol super toxic but still’
(5) Amigos cuiden sus oídos porfa a mi tmb me encanta la musica no sean boludos. Ah re serio pero posta no se rompan los tímpanos. (@clockslowed)
‘Friends, take care of your ears, please. I love music too, but don’t be dumb. Lol so serious but for real, don’t break your eardrums.’ 
My qualitative analysis demonstrates that the seemingly disparate, highly context-dependent uses of all three ah re constructions can in fact be unified under the single overarching function of speaker distancing. I propose that ah re introduces a polyphonic effect (Ducrot 1984, García Negroni 2016, 2021), allowing speakers to introduce a second enunciative voice that distances them from the propositional content of a preceding utterance, produced either by themselves or an interlocutor. To explore the various motivations for this speaker distancing—which range from laughing off a self-deprecating remark, to softening an aggressive word choice, to hedging an accusation, to rejecting another’s opinion as ridiculous—I use Brown and Levinson’s (1987) framework of politeness and facework as a template according to which the sociopragmatic effects of ah re can be neatly categorized. I show that ah re is highly versatile, used to mitigate threats to both the speaker’s and hearer’s positive and negative faces. 
Thus, I conclude that ah re, rather than constituting an example of adolescent frivolity or young people “ruining” language, is best understood as a versatile pragmatic tool which allows speakers to strategically manage discourse alignment and social rapport.

      <div style="margin-left: 1.5em; font-size: 0.95em; color: #444;">
      Abstract: The prepositional variation of grazie di/per + complement ‘thanks for X’ is often acknowledged in Italian grammars but has not yet been adequately examined. I appeal to key tenets of Construction Grammar (Goldberg, 1995, 2019) to analyze 3,000 tokens of this construction from the Italian Web 2020 Corpus (Jakubíček et al., 2013). To fully probe the conditioning of di/per selection, I pair logistic regression of the entire dataset with a descriptive statistical analysis of various levels of constructional schematicity (Pijpops et al., 2021; Diessel, 2023) and frequent individual complements. Results confirm previous descriptions (Renzi et al., 1991; Viola, 2017) that per is now the majority variant and reveal that significant predictors of preposition selection include complement type (nominal, simple infinitive, compound infinitive), as well as complement complexity and quantity of intervening material (both measured in number of words). However, strong lexi-co-constructional effects are also observed, such that the older variant di remains strongly preferred in specific micro-constructions (e.g. grazie di tutto ‘thanks for everything’, grazie di esistere ‘thanks for existing’). These findings evince a complex case of variation which requires the joint consideration of both overall patterns and fine-grained constructional distinctions.
